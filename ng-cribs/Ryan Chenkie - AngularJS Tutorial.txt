AngularJS Tutorial: [#1] Welcome! - Getting Started with AngularJS
single page webapplications
Angular1, only Front-End, no Database
AngularJS Tutorial: [#2] Installation and Set Up - Getting Started with AngularJS
WHAT WE NEED:
I) Text Editor (www.sublimetext.com)
II) Local Web Server 
(on Windows: www.wampserver.com/en (Windows,Apache,MySQL,PHP)
(on Windows/Linux: www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (Apache,MariaDB,PHP,Perl)
XAMPP: “Important! Because an activated User Account Control (UAC) on your system some functions of XAMPP are 
possibly restricted. 
With UAC please avoid to intall XAMPP to C:\Program Files (missing write permissions). 
Or deactivate UAC with msconfig after this setup.”
http://www.zeeronsolutions.com/installing-xampp-on-windows-7-user-account-control-uac-warning-message/
Advice No.1
Instead you should install XAMPP directly on a Drive. (i.e. like C:\ or D:\).
=> C:\xampp
Advice No.2
The second advice that was given was to disable the function of “User Account Control (UAC)” on Windows 7. 
However they have warned us that “Disabling UAC will lead to a less secure system”. So we have been warned!
How To Disable User Account Control (UAC) on Windows 7?
According to the instruction they had given I simply went to
    Start Menu –> Control Panel–> In the Control Panel search box just type User Account Control.
    Then you will get the results among which I found;
    “Change User Account Control Settings”
    In this User Account Control Settings Form you will find a slider that controls the level of notification 
messages you 
want when changes are done to your computer.
If you drag the slider all the way down to the bottom, you’ll have disabled it entirely. 
In my case the slider was at the level above disabling, which is, “Notify me only when programs try to make changes
 to my computer”.

[TOMCAT] Port 8080 in use by ""C:\Program Files\Atlassian\JIRA\bin\tomcat8.exe.x64" //RS//JIRASoftware161217221419"!
[TOMCAT] or reconfigure Tomcat and the Control Panel to listen on a different port
=> XAMPP Control Panel => Config => Service and Port Settings => Tomcat: Change Port 8080 to 8888 & Port 8005 to 8885
[Apache] Error: Apache shutdown unexpectedly.
[Apache] This may be due to a blocked port, missing dependencies, 
[Apache] improper privileges, a crash, or a shutdown by another method.
=> Open IIS and click on STOP

Stop & Deactivate Services "World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW-Publishing Service)", "Web Deployment Agent Service" and all MSSQLSERVER Services

AngularJS Tutorial: [#3] Controllers and Views - Getting Started with AngularJS
In this part we See how we can use JSON data in application & use some of Angulars Features to display data on screen
I) MVC(Model-View-Controller): usefull if applications grows & more people work on it
Model: Database Communication
View: Content Displayed on the Screen
Controller: Ties the Model and View Together
II) ANGULAR MVC-approach, but little different:
Model: are Properties of Scope
View: HTML Template rendered for User to see
Controller: contains Business Logic for App
III) SCOPE: 
+ its an object that ties Controller & View together
+ on Scope you can keep Properties and Functions that can be used by the View
IV) Two-Way Data Binding:
+ 1 Single Source of Truth
+ Changes Reflected Automatically Everywhere
=>EXAMPLE: Text-Element on Page & Input was bound to that Text-Element, whenever you make change in Input it will reflected
automatically on the Text-Element
+ App Data Stays in Sync

AngularJS Tutorial: [#4] Switching to Services - Getting Started with AngularJS
cribsController.js:
Extract Data from Controller to Factory/Service
In Controller should be Business-Logic, Controller should be as thin as possible
Code in Facotry/Service can be used in more then 1 controller
===========================================================================================================================
AngularJS Tutorial: [#5] HTTP - Getting Started with AngularJS
AngularJS is Front-End Only, NO Back-End (Database, Scripting-Language on Server)
If we want to interact with data from a server, we have to expose an HTTP-Server that serves up our data!!!
1) $http (HTTP-Service) serves up data
METHODS:
POST
GET
PUT
DELETE
Another way to do HTTP-Request with Angular: resource is designed to work with RESTfull API. 
+ It gives us methods like query, save & remove. 
+ Its an abstraction over HTTP-Service (HTTP Lower Level Service).

AngularJS Tutorial: [#6] Creating the User Interface - Getting Started with AngularJS
Angular Build-In Directives for The User Interface:
ng-click		
ng-show / ng-hide	
ng-model	#allows 2-way-data-binding
ng-src	#instead of source; page looks for image {{crib.image}}.jpg: ng-src displays picture only after compilation
